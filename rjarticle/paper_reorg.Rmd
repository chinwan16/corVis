## Introduction




As a first stage in an analysis, numerical and graphical variable summaries are explored. Bivariate patterns can be explored with correlation matrices and scatterplot matrices.
Typically these are applied to numerical variables only, though there are generalisations of scatterplot matrices (ggally). Mention corrgram. Many datasets are a mix of variable types, and our goal is to investigate and visualise associations among these. New package corVis fills a gap.


In this work we produce displays of bivariate association, using measures suitable for numerical, ordinal and nominal variables. 
For numeric variables we go beyond Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlation, and use
methods such as ..... which are capabale of capturing non-linear patterns.

Our first display uses a matrix-layout, similar to corrgram. A novel feature is that our version can show multiple association measures for each pair of variables, so that patterns other than linear association can be uncovered. For high-dimensional datasets matrix layouts become unwieldy and run out of space, so our second display uses a linear layout, showing one or more association measures for each pair of variables. This is especially useful when the analyst wishes to limit the display to pairs of variables showing non-negligible association.

We also present displays of bivariate association grouped by levels of a categorical variable, again using matrix and linear layouts. Use of seriation.


Outline of paper




## Section 2 Background

This section needs some work. See my comments on Dec 21. Delete Figure 1.


Instead of organsing by vis package, organise by type display.  matrix layouts, linear layouts, graph layouts.

Seriation of corrplot etc goes here.

## Section 4 

You could use corplot on the assocs. (use of matrix_assoc)
You could use linkspotter on our measures also I assume (check this). We do not need to re-invent the wheel here.
Do we need a conversion of our assoc structure to that used by linkspotter?

Discuss rationale behind design choices.
Looked pie/wedges, (someone else use this), harder to compare radii, sign had to be encoded by color, or zero at mid point, but did not give proper attention to negative values.

network plots done in linkspotter or corrr. 
Does facetting work in either of these?  We would need the same node positions across the facets.
(You could use vivid for this.)
This could be done with multiple measures or subgroups.
Try doing a vignette using linkspotter.

## Discussion

mention use of corvis for scagnostics
