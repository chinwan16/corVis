Minutes of Meeting (17/02/2023):

Points discussed:

- not a good idea to use  dataset from learningtower
- for multiple measure display, no need to take absolute values
- get rid of vartypes attributes from assoc structure
- maybe have different class attributes for different situations such as: pairwise, cond_pairwise, multi_pairwise
- use these class attributes to plot different assoc structures
- make adjustment to seriation accordingly
- update documentation with these changes
- think about what needs to be done if few pairs of variables are missing

Need to work on:

- different class attributes for different situations
- adjustment to seriation
- update documentation
