Minutes of Meeting (14/02/2023):

Points discussed:

- use other packages for producing displays with assocs (maybe leave out linkspotter, corrgrapher)
- ordering only provided using lassoc at the moment. think what can be done for uassoc. Also, think about what to do when a user inputs a different order for x and y with lassoc. An argument "var_order" with either a vector of variables with appropriate length or "default" for Dendser. maybe reorder_vars or reorder_measures
- two different functions for ordering variables and ordering lollipops
- store the pair type as "n.n", "n.f", "o.o", "f.f"
- correct the Dendser code
- try out examples using LPL seriation method.
- maybe a different dataset

Need to work on:

- examples using LPL seriation to verify it works for our displays
- take a look at network displays
- maybe use a different dataset.
