Minutes of Meeting (10/02/2023):

Points discussed:

- With linkspotter, good idea to take their code and make it more flexible
- For corrgrapher, take a look at their code
- mention about corrgrapher do not separate out calculation and visualisation in the paper.
- include package mbgraphic in the package
- store the pair type as a variable in assoc
- think about what can be plotted along the diagonal if variable names are put in default way
- use lazypath length ordering from Dendser package
- For ordering the multiple measures plot in matrix layout, maybe take maximum not max_diff for ordering. For conditioning, max_diff is okay.
- can use clustering on correlation of multiple association measures for ordering the lollipops

Need to work on:

- use lazypath length ordering from Dendser package
- For ordering the multiple measures plot in matrix layout, maybe take maximum not max_diff for ordering. For conditioning, max_diff is okay.
- use clustering on correlation of multiple association measures for ordering the lollipops
