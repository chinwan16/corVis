Plan of action:

I am working on my first research paper on Visualising Association and Conditional Association currently and I think it is in its final stages. I will finish up the paper and submit it to R Journal by mid February. I'm also working on a package which aims to identify and visualise interesting pairs and triples of variables using the measures calculated in corVis package. As I am already familiar with creating R packages, I think I'll be ready to submit the package and a related paper by end of May. Simultaneously, I plan to work on my Thesis by writing up chapters like Introduction and Literature Review. I'll be writing a chapter on extending the above mentioned packages with general measures like scagnostics. Also, I plan to extend the packages with sophisticated seriation techniques. I am working hard on my writing skills and I think it will improve as I write more.
