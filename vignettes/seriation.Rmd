Ordered graphical displays provide a better understanding of the data than unordered displays by making it considerably easier to identify patterns or structures. Examples include Friendly (2002) who demonstrated ordered correlation displays so that groups of variables with high mutual correlation are quickly highlighted and Hurley (2004) who ordered variables in a scatterplot matrix so that interesting panels were positioned close to the main diagonal. Both cases illustrate how seriation, a term to describe ordering of objects, is useful to reveal patterns that were not apparent with default ordering of variables. This vignette focuses on the seriation techniques used for matrix and linear displays in _corVis_.

if (!requireNamespace("palmerpenguins", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("palmerpenguins")

library(corVis)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(ggplot2)

df <- palmerpenguins::penguins
names(df) <- c("species", "island", "bill_l", "bill_d", "flip_l", "mass", "sex", "year")

a_order <- c( "bill_d", "bill_l", "flip_l", "island", "mass", "sex", "species", "year")
```


## Matrix displays

In many of the seriation algorithms for matrix displays, the first step is to produce a dissimilarity or similarity matrix of objects to be clustered. Here, objects are the variables of a dataset. For each cell in the matrix, a seriation weight $w_{ij}$ for variables $i$ and $j$, which measures the importance of the cell, is assigned. In many cases, $w_{ij}$ is a measure of variable dissimilarity. The second step is to perform a hierarchical clustering using the seriation weights $w_{ij}$ which yields a dendrogram. The final step is to rearrange the nodes of the dendrogram such that the ordering of the nodes minimizes a cost function. This produces an ordering where important variable pairs are placed adjacent or nearby each other. As people generally read from left to right, placing the most important cells at the beginning or top-left corner of the display allows an analyst to immediately identify important pairs of variables. By selecting appropriate cost function, we provide this feature for our matrix displays.

We use the Lazy path length (LPL) cost function proposed by Earle and Hurley (2015) to order the matrix displays. Let $\pi$ be an order obtained from the hierarchical clustering of a matrix with n variables using the seriation weights $w_{ij}$. Then, LPL cost function for an order $\pi$ is defined as:

$LPL(\pi) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (n-1) w_{\pi(i),\pi(i+1)}$

LPL is a weighted measure of path length and awards orders with short path lengths and where the weights generally increase. The method provides a form of importance sorting and is efficient in making interesting pairs more prominent in matrix displays by placing them at the start and top-left position.

<!-- We use seriation algorithm from Earle and Hurley (2015) to achieve this for our displays. The first step is to perform hierarchical clustering of a dissimilarity matrix (either for association measure display, multiple measures display or conditional measure display). This yields a dendrogram with an ordering where highly similar variables, depending on the display, are nearby. When used in a matrix display, this ordering brings similar variables close to the diagonal. In order to put these variables on the top-left corner we need an additional sorting step. This step uses seriation weights $w_{ij}$, where $w_{ij}$ measures the importance of comparison for variables $(i,j)$ and a cost function, where the main goal is to find a dendrogram ordering which minimizes the cost function. The cost function we use in _corVis_ is lazy path length (LPL) which is a variant of travelling salesman problem and rewards a short path with increasing weights.  -->

We use the sorting approach discussed above for all of our matrix displays to obtain variable ordering.

### Association measure display

The association measure display plots a measure of association for variable pairs in a dataset. The plotting function `plot_assoc_matrix` takes a data structure with variable pairs and corresponding measures as input. For ordering the variables, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed first where the dissimilarity is measured by $-|m_{ij}|$, where $m_{ij}$ is the association measure value for a variable pair $(i,j)$. This is followed by hierarchical clustering using the seriation weights (similar to the dissimilarity measure), which produces an order such that the LPL cost function is minimised.  

Figure 1 compares the alphabetical ordering of the variables in the dataset with ordering obtained by seriation using LPL cost function. The plot on the right shows highly associated variables at the top left corner of the display, making it easier for an analyst to identify associated pairs instantly.

```{r assoc_display, fig.show="hold", out.width="40%", echo=TRUE, fig.align='default'}
assoc_penguin <- calc_assoc(df)
plot_assoc_matrix(assoc_penguin, var_order = a_order)
plot_assoc_matrix(assoc_penguin)
```

A user can also supply their own ordering perhaps obtained from other algorithm by specifying `var_order` argument in the `plot_assoc_matrix` function.

### Multiple measures display

The multiple measures display plots multiple measures of association for every variable pair in the dataset. For the seriation of this display, a similarity matrix is obtained by taking the maximum association measure value for a variable pair. Let $m_{ij}$ denote the maximum value of the association measure for pair $(i,j)$. A hierarchical clustering is then performed with seriation weights $w_{ij} = - |m_{ij}|$ and an optimal ordering is found using the LPL cost function. 

We also use seriation to order multiple measure types in each cell of the multiple measures display. We follow the same strategy by first constructing a dissimilarity matrix of the association measures. Dissimilarity between the pairs of measure types is measured by -|Pearson correlation|. This is followed by hierarchical clustering using weights the same as the dissimilarity measure. We find the optimal ordering using the LPL criterion. 

Figure 2 shows a comparison of multiple measures display before and after seriation. The plot on the right displays variable pairs with high measure value(s) on the top left corner, making it easier to find pairs of variables where any of the measures is high.

```{r multi_display, fig.show="hold", out.width="40%", echo=TRUE, fig.align='default'}
df_num <- dplyr::select(df,where(is.numeric))

multi_assoc_penguins <- calc_assoc_all(df_num)

plot_assoc_matrix(multi_assoc_penguins, var_order = names(df_num))
plot_assoc_matrix(multi_assoc_penguins)
```

### Conditional association measures display

The conditional association measure display plots pairwise association measures at different levels of a conditioning variable. For ordering the variables, we use a similar strategy as with the case of multiple measures display. The only difference is that a similarity matrix is constructed by taking the maximum difference among association measure values at different levels of the conditioning variable for a variable pair.

For ordering levels of the conditioning variable, we follow a similar approach used for ordering measure types in multiple measures display. 

Figure 3 shows the difference in conditional association measure displays before and after seriation. The variable pairs with high differences in measure value for a grouping variable are placed at the beginning of the seriated display on the right. This helps in quickly finding pairs with high group differences. The plot shows variable pairs (`flip_l`, `bill_d`) and (`flip_l`, `mass`) with high difference in measure value at different levels of the conditioning variable `species`.
```{r cond_display, fig.show="hold", out.width="40%", echo=TRUE, fig.align='default'}
cond_assoc_penguins <- calc_assoc(df,by="species")

a_order_cond <- c("bill_d", "bill_l", "flip_l", "island", "mass", "sex", "year")

plot_assoc_matrix(cond_assoc_penguins, var_order = a_order_cond)
plot_assoc_matrix(cond_assoc_penguins)
```

## Linear displays

In addition to matrix displays, we provide linear displays in the form of dot plots or heatmaps for plotting association measures and conditional association measures in _corVis_. Linear layouts are especially useful when the analyst wishes to limit the display to pairs of variables showing non-negligible association. We use two basic sorting techniques to seriate the variable pairs in these displays.

The first technique involves using the maximum absolute value for ordering the variable pairs. In the case of multiple measures and conditional measures display, the variable pairs are ordered in descending order by the maximum absolute measure value of the available measures for each pair. This produces a display with highly associated variable pairs at the top, simplifying the task to identify associated variables.

Figure 4 shows the seriated linear display where it is easier to find highly associated variable pairs in the plot compared to a plot with default varaible pairs ordering. The variable pairs such as (mass, flip_l) and (sex, mass) are placed at the top of the display and are strongly associated.

```{r linear_cond_max,echo=TRUE}
plot_assoc_linear(cond_assoc_penguins, plot_type = "dotplot")
```

The second technique uses the maximum difference among the value of the measures to order variable pairs. The pairs of variables are ordered in descending order by the maximum difference value. As a result of this ordering, the variable pairs with a maximum difference are placed on the top of the display, making it easier for an analyst to find variable pairs with a high difference.

Figure 5 shows a seriated linear display using the maximum difference technique. It is easier to spot the variable pairs with high differences in the plot. The variable pairs (flip_l, bill_d) and (mass, bill_d) are placed at the top of the display and have highest difference among the measures.
```{r linear_cond_max_diff,echo=TRUE}
plot_assoc_linear(cond_assoc_penguins, plot_type = "dotplot",pair_order = "max_diff")
```
